# Web Demo UI Mock  

This folder contains a **mock demo UI** of the SharedPreferences management and editor interfaces.  
These pages represent the **login, listing, and editing views** that appear when the server is started.  

- `login.html` → Login interface for SharedPreferences management  
- `main.html` → SharedPreferences management interface (view, search, create, delete)  
- `editor.html` → SharedPreferences editor interface (edit key–value pairs)  

⚠️ **Note:**  
These files only showcase the **static user interface design** and are **not part of the actual application code**.  
No functional logic is implemented.  

## 🚀 How to Open  

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open any of the `.html` files directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
   - Example: Double-click `login.html` to preview the login UI.  
3. Explore the different pages (`main.html`, `editor.html`) to view their static layouts.
