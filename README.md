 ## How It Works

1. **Decompile the APK** using your preferred tool (e.g., MT Manager).  
2. **Inject** the file `classic<series_number>.dex` into the target APK.  
   *(Replace `<series_number>` with the actual DEX number you are using.)*  
3. **Invoke the Smali code** from the `LauncherActivity` to start the `PrefsHooker` service:  
   ```smali
   # Place this code inside the onCreate() method
   
   sget-object v0, Lkoshurboii/PrefsHooker/€¶€¢€•;->€•:Lkoshurboii/PrefsHooker/€¶€¢€•;
    invoke-virtual {v0}, Lkoshurboii/PrefsHooker/€¶€¢€•;->€•()V
   ```  
4. **Save your changes** and rebuild the APK.  
5. **Open the app**; a persistent notification will appear, indicating that the server has started.  
   > **Note:** For Android 11+ devices, make sure to add the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission in the manifest.  
6. **Click on "Open in Browser"** from the notification.  
   It will redirect you to your browser (Chrome recommended) where you can view and edit SharedPreferences remotel.
